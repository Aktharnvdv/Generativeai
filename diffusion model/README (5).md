# Transformer Model for Sequence-to-Sequence Tasks
    This repository contains the implementation of a Transformer model for sequence-to-sequence tasks, including a PyTorch 
    Lightning training setup.

# Colab Notebook
    The code is originally from the Colab Notebook Transformer.ipynb.

# Requirements
    Install the necessary library:

```bash

pip install pytorch_lightning
```
# Usage
    The code defines a Transformer model for sequence-to-sequence tasks. It includes the following components:

    PositionalEncoding: Classic attention-is-all-you-need positional encoding.
    generate_square_subsequent_mask: Function to generate a triangular mask.
    Transformer: The main Transformer model that both encodes and decodes.
    LitModel: A PyTorch Lightning model for training the Transformer.
# How to Use
    Install the required library using the provided command.
    Load your dataset or use the provided synthetic dataset.
    Initialize the Transformer model (Transformer).
    Set hyperparameters such as the number of classes, maximum output length, etc.
    Initialize the PyTorch Lightning model (LitModel) with the Transformer model.
    Configure the optimizer and other training settings.
    Run the training loop using the PyTorch Lightning Trainer.

# Inference
    The predict method in the Transformer class is used for greedy decoding at inference time. You can modify it for your 
    specific inference needs.
